Well... I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
Said I got a woman, way over town
Good to me, oh yeah!
She gives me money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a kind of friend indeed
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah!
She saves her loving, early in the morning
Just for me, oh yeah!
She saves her loving, just for me
Oh! She love me so tenderly
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
She's there to love me
Both day and night
Never grumbles or fusses
Always treats me right
Never running in the streets
Leaving me alone
She knows a woman's place
Is right there now in her home
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
Said I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
Oh! She is my baby, don't you understand
Yeahh ahh I'm her loving man
I got a woman, way over town
That's good to me, oh yeah!
Don't you know she's alright
Don't you know she's alright
She's alright, she's alright
Whoa yeah, oh yeah!
