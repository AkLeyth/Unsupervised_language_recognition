We're standing still in silence
Hearing the water drip
Can't keep the tears from falling
If only you'd look at me
And all the things I shouldn't say
Were said anyways
(I'm so sorry)
You got me feeling reckless
Oh, you say I've changed
You say that you meant forever
And that you still feel the same
And all the things I shouldn't say
Were said anyways
(I'm so sorry)
Give me something, something that's real
To make me feel loved again, mhm
Show me something, something that's real
To make me feel loved again
Darling, that is what you said
Baby, that is what you said
How do I mend what's broken?
How do I turn around?
Half of my heart regrets it
If only you changed my mind
And I let love drift away
When you're begging me to say
Ooh, oh
Give me something, something that's real
To make me feel loved again, oh
Show me something, something that's real
To make me feel loved again (Ooh)
And I know, I know, I know
Nights will be cold, no head on my shoulder
No one to hold
Tell me how you forget
Show me something, something that's real
Just wanna feel loved again
Darling, that is what you said
(Ooh, ooh)
Darling, that is what you said
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
There's nothing that you could say
That you could do now
Oh, oh
Give me something, something that's real
To make me feel loved again, oh
Just show me something, something that's real
To make me feel love again
Darling, that is what you said
